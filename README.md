**Numberoid** is a collection of some Python functions that may be used to solve simple Numerical Analysis problems.

###Why called "Numberoid"?
I couldn't think of any other name. Before switching to Numberoid, the project's name was `NoName`.

##Capabilities

Matrix calculations:
  - Finding the determinant of a square matrix
  - Finding a minor of a square matrix
  - Transposing a matrix
  - Inverting a square matrix
  - Scalar multiplication
  - Matrix multiplication
  - Solving a system of linear equations by multiplying two matrices that characterize the system.
  
Numerical integration:
  - Riemann integral calculator


##ToDo
  - Add more numerical integration formulas
