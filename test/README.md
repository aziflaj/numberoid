Some of the functions at `pymatrix.py` throw exceptions such as [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError). You should write a test case for these methods to check if they raise the error.
 - minor_matrix (2 cases)
 - determinant
 - inverse (2 cases)
 - multiply
